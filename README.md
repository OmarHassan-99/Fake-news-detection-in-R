# Fake-news-detection-in-R
In the era of information overload, distinguishing real news from fake has never been more critical. This project presents a comprehensive solution to tackle fake news using cutting-edge data science techniques in R.
This project focuses on building a robust Fake News Detection system using R. The pipeline includes:

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing raw text data for consistency and usability.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features to enhance model performance.
Classification Models: Implementing and comparing multiple models.
Evaluation and Analysis: Comparing model performances using metrics and visualizations.
